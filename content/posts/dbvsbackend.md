Hello everyone.Â This is the first blog on my own website. Before that I write  some blogs on [dev.to](https://dev.to/byksy) and [medium.com](https://mbyksy.medium.com/), you can easily check my past blogs via click these links. My blogs were very messy and I wanted to write from one website. So I change my thoughts forward to my own blog site. 

## A new journey

When you start a new job, you have to force yourself to do it. You might think that new starts are easy and you are eager to start quickly. However, the first step may be hard when you want to start a journey. Maybe you have a plan for how to handle any problem that you encounter or you have a schedule to sit on the chair and do your job. But when the time comes it is hard to take the first step because you know this is a long journey and you do have not enough energy to do that. You get upset and then you quit the job and maybe your journey. New journeys have excited most of us. If you embark on a new journey such as a new job, what you need is to take a step. Keep in your mind that your journey finishes well if you work hard and have a good plan.

Working as a software engineer has been a big chance for my life because it is my childhood dream. After becoming a software engineer, you choose a profession for your career. For example, if you enjoy user interface on the web, your profession may be fronted developer, or want to understand data processing in the software tools you may choose database engineer, administrator, or data engineer. After choosing your profession, generally, you work in this special area, so your job title grows from junior to senior level. It is rare to choose another profession after your title becomes senior. My career is a sample for changing careers after a senior level. In this blog, I talk about why I left the senior database engineer title and continue as a backend developer in my life. Also, you will find what we understand as database engineering and the pros and cons of two different professions. Letâ€™s start.

## Ex-Database Engineer 

I had 5 years of experience in database engineering and 4 months as a backend developer. I had liked to understand the databases such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL, write efficient queries, functions, and procedures, optimize queries, analyze the performance and monitor the data processing and vice versa. Also, I tried to increase the database performance with load testing using the Jmeter test tool and monitor the metrics on the Grafana dashboards. The load test is known to be a performance test for your application. What I am doing by analyzing the Grafana dashboard is clearly understanding our system capacity or measuring scalability.

One major obstacle for the database engineer in a startup firm is, of course, the repetitive state and stability to be up-to-date with changing technology. But it also helps me understand how database engineer should be in the real world. When I apply for many jobs abroad, they are looking for a database administrator, not a database engineer. Maybe their job title is database engineer but you understand they want to hire a person who maintains the database, monitoring, and automates some processes via Ansible, Powershell, etc. In the real life I was only a SQL developer so as you guessed they didn't hire me ðŸ™‚Â 

### A Backend Developer?

I had a knowledge about the Rest-API modeling and write many lines of code CRUD operations. I was not a backend developer but also I was not a database engineer in the real life. So I decided to leave my comfort zone and choose a real profession. I had a two options: either backend developer or database administrator. I have no concern to the database administrator job because I want to work in startup companies, so I chose the backend developer, there was no in-between. Then I met the Navlungo and changed my life. I have been a backend developer since May 2022 and Iâ€™m excited to be part of this fantastic team.

> Whatâ€™s best about the backend developer in the Navlungo isnâ€™t how well you work, but how well you work with pleasure. I keep learning many things and keep improving my abilities. Interestingly enough, I realized that what I didn't know about coding was more than what I knew.

## Pick a card ðŸ™‚

To sum up, I can start to write some advantages and disadvantages of backend developer and database engineer, then you are free to choose one of two.

**Advantages:**

Database Engineer

---

- Have a strong knowledge of SQL language, stored procedures, and query optimization
- Have a knowledge of the storage system for performance optimization
- Some networking knowledge of TCP, HTTP, UDP, the band with, etc. keeps you one step ahead.
- Performance tests can be helpful if you are interested.
- Have knowledge of database design and configuration.

Backend Developer (.Net Core)

---

- Have knowledge of OOP, SOLID, DRY, etc. principles. Your wisdom change when you are coding.
- Have a chance to work on microservice structures. For instance, you can learn DDD and CQRS approaches and implement these methodologies in your codebase.
- Have a knowledge code-first or database-first approach with Ef Core
- Have a good way to understand the N-layer structures and communication between them. (Learn clean architecture might fit your app, think about it. )
- Learn and implement caching structures - Redis, Memcached, etc. - in your codebase and improve your app performance.

**Disadvantages:**

Database Engineer

---
- Finding yourself constantly reporting for the customers.
- Possibility of staying away from new technology approaches.
- Querying can be boring sometimes.
- App constraints such as not using open source relational or NoSQL database systems such as Couchbase or MongoDB may be obstacles to your self-improvement.
- Stuck between performance problems caused by huge data and customer requests.

Backend Developer (.Net Core)

---
- I didnâ€™t find any disadvantages to a backend developer, because I am new to this job. After a while, if I find any deficit, this page will be edited.

As you see, I am happy to work as a backend engineer. There are a lot of things to learn, and this is just the beginning. Getting better I will continue to improve my skills.
